# First-rails-project

Hello!
This is my first Ruby on Rails project, out of many future ones. It is a simple web app for creating and managing football tournament (admin) and watching through the data (not loggged users) like stats about teams and players, outcome of the games or upcoming fixtures.
As this beeing my first project it can be a little messy and chaotic in some places, but future projects will be better I promise!

Ruby version: 2.7.1

Rails version: 6.1.3.1

You can see this project in action right here: https://projektpilka.herokuapp.com/home

In order to edit data on herokuapp you have to login with this user:

login: marcin

password: marcin

Or create your own user with rails console if you cloned this project.


Cheers!
